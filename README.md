# Project Overview

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to successfully execute a comprehensive Mechanical and Programming project.

## Project Description

### Mechanical Component

The mechanical component of the project involves the design, fabrication, and implementation of a 'Robot Stand'. This stand must allow the team to work in a comfortable position on all sides of the robot. This will require correspondance with the current IGVC team.

### Programming Component

The programming component of the project involves the understanding and usage of Linux/Ubuntu, ROS, and Python to complete line following. The focal point of this repository will be this. Reach out to the current IGVC team when you have questions. Below outlines the directories.
