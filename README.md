# Project Overview

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to successfully execute a comprehensive Mechanical and Programming project.

## Project Description

### Mechanical Component

The mechanical component of the project involves the design, fabrication, and implementation of a 'Robot Stand'. This stand must allow the team to work in a comfortable position on all sides of the robot. This will require correspondance with the current IGVC team.

### Programming Component

The programming component of the project involves the understanding of Linux/Ubuntu, ROS, and Python. The focal point of this repository will be this portion of the Designette. Below outlines the directories:

#### 'resources'

- Install Ubuntu using VirtualBox (00_Software_Installation)
- Useful commands for Ubuntu (01_Introduction_to_Ubuntu)
- Understand ROS and the environment (02_Getting_Started_with_ROS)
- References for commonly used applications of the following: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib (Introduction_to_....)
- Creating a ROS workspace (03_Writing_ROS_Programs_Python)
- Understanding the dynamic reconfigure (Dynamic_Reconfigure)
- Necessary resources for the completion of the project (Color_Spaces, Computer_Vision_Adv)
